// This  exercise is same as 01-promise ex1.js, just that we want to do it in 
// synchronous way with async/await

// In this exercise, we would like you to build a function, 
// inside the function, it should call a simple API and print out the response from the API.
// You should use axios to call the API
// Do note that you will need to install the axios node module first

// Axios documentation: https://axios-http.com/docs/intro

// API to be call:
// GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users


const axios = require('axios');

// Write you code below
const callAPI = 




// DO NOT EDIT THE CODE BELOW
callAPI()


// Expected output (it looks ugly but you should at least see status code of 200):
// {status: 200, statusText: 'OK', headers: {…}, config: {…}, request: ClientRequest, …}
