// This  exercise is same as 01-promise ex3.js, just that we want to do it in 
// synchronous way with async/await

// This is the continue of ex2.js
// In this exercise, we want you to filter the result based on their user id
// We would only want to keep the users with odd number as user id

// Hint: You can use any method to filter them out,
// but the easiest is to convert then into an object, then use the JavsScript filter function
// If you forget how to do that, you can reference
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter

const axios = require('axios');

// Write you code below
const callAPI = 

// DO NOT EDIT THE CODE BELOW
callAPI()

// Expected Output: Same as ex2, but only with users of odd number user ID
